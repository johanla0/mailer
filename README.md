**Case:** we want to collect photos of the paperwork from our students once they finish it.

**Problem:** mail server delays from China to Russia which took up to several hours depending on many factors, one of them is attachment size.

**Solution:** compress/resize image on the client side then send to the designated e-mail address.

This tool is intended to provide students with a basic form to send their paperwork to the university mail servers.
